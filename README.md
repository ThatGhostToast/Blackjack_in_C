# Blackjack
This is my semester project for ITT-310. </br>
It's the game blackjack as a console application written in C </br>

### Code Use
If you plan on using my code, have fun! Please remember to cite me if you're using it for an assignment.</br>
#### Please Note
This application was developed in VSCode on Mac. If you are using VisualStudio you may run into some errors but they are easily fixed (usually just a character difference or two).
